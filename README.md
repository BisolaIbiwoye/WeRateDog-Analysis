# WeRateDog-Analysis
This project enunciate the analysis and visualization of WeRateDogs Twitter account created by Matt Nelson, the twitter account has over 5000 tweets which were made available in the archive as of August 1, 2017. Appropriate python libraries such as tweepy, pandas, numpy, requests, json, matplotlib and seaborn were used to gather, read, assess, clean and visualize the data. The first step involved data wrangling, where data were gathered from three sources (Twitter archive, a URL lint and Twitter API), cleaned and stored in a master dataframe.
After the data wrangling process, the curated master dataframe was analyzed and appropriate visualizations were carried out on the data. 

The data analysis was guided by the following questions;

I. Which month had the highest number of tweets and which month had the lowest?

Ii. What device are people tweeting from?

Iii. Is there a relationship between retweet count and favorite count?
